## Your Adventure Awaits... 

#### **Purpose of this assignment:**

*   Learn how to read other software developers' code.
*   Learn how to ask questions TO a developer about how their code works.
*   Practice Object Oriented Programming techniques by studying an example.
*   Modify other people's code to suit YOUR needs.
*   Be creative!

The initial program code that you are given has basic functionality. However, as you work on this project you will be tasked with making changes and implementing additional features into the game.

#### **Getting Started:**

1. Click on the Download .zip button at the top of this page, extract the folder, and open the project using an IDE such as intellij.

2. Run the program a few times and play around with the game. 

3. Come back to this website and peruse around to gain more information about the code.

#### **Assignment Details:**

**Part 1**
- Navigate the information on this website and learn about how the program works. 
- Plan out the story of your adventure game. 
  - What rooms will be in your adventure? 
  - What items will be there? 
  - Are there any additional features you might want to implement?
- Create your game map on paper first- what rooms will there be and how will they connect?
- Make changes to the csv files so that the game has the rooms, items, and events that you came up with.

**Part 2**
- Identify a feature that you'd like to add to the game. Work on implementing your feature into the game by working with other classmates and Mr. Wolff. Don't hesitate to ask Mr. Wolff questions about what direction to go for the feature you choose to implement.
- It may help to start with some ideas for features to work on:
  - Adding a turn tracker. Maybe the game ends after some # of turns.
  - Making paths only work if you have a specific item.
  - Adding monsters that you can attack!
  - Making the UI neater and more interesting for the player.
- For this part, you will be evaluated on your effort, communication, and how well you challenge yourself during this project.
- You WILL NOT be evaluated on whether or not the feature is successfully implemented. Some features will be more difficult than others, and that's great!
